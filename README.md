Use dogs API to search for dog breeds and present the results to the user.
It's up to you to decide how far you want to go, time permitting.
Have fun!


## Technical Requirements
- [x]  Must read from the dogapi endpoint (docs). signup for a free account to get the API key
- [x] Write tests for your code.

## How to submit
- [x] Use CodeSandbox. Create a sandbox and submit the url to us.
- [x] You may choose any starting template provided that you are comfortable with.

## Implementation Details
- [x] User input should be debounced for 1 sec ( system must wait for 1 sec after user stops typing before calling the search api )
- [x] The list of dogs must be sortable by
    - Name
    - Height
    - Lifespan
- [x] See dogapi docs for details about the api format.

## Brownie Points
- [x]  Write your own debounce function with unit tests
- [x]  Show loading indicator for the images as they being downloaded
- [x]  Find and handle an error in the response data format.
